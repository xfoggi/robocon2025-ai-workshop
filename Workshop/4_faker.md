# Creating Faker-like Keywords Powered by AI

## Introduction

The Faker library is a popular Python package used to generate fake data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and more. It is widely used in testing and prototyping to populate systems with realistic-looking data without using real user information.

In this section, we will explore how to create **Faker-like keywords powered by AI** for Robot Framework. Instead of relying solely on a static library like Faker, we will leverage the OpenAI API to generate dynamic and realistic fake data tailored to our specific needs.

## Goals

We aim to build Robot Framework keywords that use AI to generate the following types of data:

- **Phone Numbers:** In international format (e.g., `+1-123-456-7890`).
- **Addresses:** Realistic addresses including street, city, state/province, postal code, and country.
- **Emails:** Realistic email addresses that mimic real-world patterns.

## Data Generation Requirements

### 1. Phone Numbers

- **Format:**  
  The phone number should be in international format and include:
  - A country code (e.g., `+1` for the USA, `+44` for the UK).
  - An area code and local number properly formatted (e.g., `+1-123-456-7890`).

- **Output:**  
  A single string representing a phone number in a valid international format.

### 2. Addresses

- **Components:**  
  The generated address should include the following elements:
  - **Street:** A realistic street name and number.
  - **City:** A plausible city name.
  - **State/Province:** An appropriate region or state.
  - **Postal Code:** A valid postal code.
  - **Country:** The country name.

- **Output:**  
  The address can be returned either as a formatted string or as a structured JSON object. For example, the JSON format could be:

```json
{
  "street": "123 Main St",
  "city": "Anytown",
  "state": "CA",
  "postal_code": "90210",
  "country": "USA"
}
```

### 3. Emails

- **Format:**  
  The email address should resemble real-world email addresses. Requirements include:
  - A realistic username (which could be derived from a name or a random string).
  - A valid domain name (e.g., `example.com` or another common domain).
  - The email should follow standard formatting (e.g., `username@example.com`).

- **Output:**  
  A single string representing a realistic email address. For example:

```text
john.doe@example.com
```

## How It Works

1. **Keyword Implementation:**  
   We will create custom Robot Framework keywords that call the OpenAI API. The AI prompt will instruct the model to generate either a fake phone number, a fake address, or a fake email according to our specified requirements.

2. **Prompts:**  
   - For **Phone Numbers:**  
     The prompt might be:  
     > "Generate a fake phone number in international format."
     
   - For **Addresses:**  
     The prompt might be:  
     > "Generate a realistic address including street, city, state, postal code, and country in JSON format."
     
   - For **Emails:**  
     The prompt might be:  
     > "Generate a realistic email address that looks like it could belong to a person."

3. **Output Processing:**  
   The keywords will process the AI response to ensure it meets the required format. The processed data will then be returned to the Robot Framework test case as a string or a JSON object.

## Example Usage in Robot Framework

Once implemented, you might use these keywords in a Robot Framework test suite as follows:

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    YourFakerAIPoweredLibrary.py

*** Test Cases ***
Generate Fake Phone Number
    ${phone}=    Generate Fake Phone Number
    Log    ${phone}

Generate Fake Address
    ${address}=    Generate Fake Address
    Log    ${address}

Generate Fake Email
    ${email}=    Generate Fake Email
    Log    ${email}
```
