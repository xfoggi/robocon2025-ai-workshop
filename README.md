# OpenAI Swarm Project

This repository contains materials related to **Workshop** and **Talk** about **Robot Framework**, OpenAI and **AI** agent orchestration.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

- **`Workshop/`** - Contains materials for the Integration of OpenAI with Robot Framework, including:
  - Example implementations using Robot Framework.
  - Guides on setting up and running OpenAI-based automation.
  - Tutorials and hands-on exercises for integrating OpenAI Swarm.

- **`Talk/`** - Contains materials for the **talk on OpenAI Swarm**, including:
  - Presentation slides and supporting documents.
  - Code examples used in the talk.
  - Demos demonstrating OpenAI Swarm in action.

## Summary of the Project

This project explores how to leverage **Robot Framework** for automation and AI-driven solutions with **OpenAI**. The **workshop** provides a deep dive into practical implementation, while the **talk** presents high-level insight and experimentation with OpenAI Agents & orchestration.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to OpenAI library.
- Using AI in test automation with Robot Framework.
- OpenAI Swarm orchestration and distributed AI agents.
- Real-world applications and best practices.
